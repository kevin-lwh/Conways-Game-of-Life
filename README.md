# Conways-Game-of-Life
A simple demonstration of Conway's Game of Life.

## Requirements
* NetBeans or any Java IDE

## Instructions
Simply open the GameOfLife project in NetBeans or other Java IDE to hit run. Once the simulation has started, it will last for 500 generations starting with random planted cells.

## Rules
Each cell is only depended on its neighboring cells and each cells has two states of either being alive or dead. The simulation follows the rules below:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
